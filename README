Whack a Mole

Game Objective:

Whack a mole is an arcade game. You are presented with a grid and a mole randomly pops through one of the cells.
Your objective is to whack the mole each time it pops to get a point.
You are exected to score points with the time limit. 


Thought Process:

To code this game, we need

1) The access to every cell of the grid
2) The access to the score
3) The access to the timer
4) A function for the mole to move randomly
5) We need to check whether the player clicks on the mole
6) With each click on the mole, the score should go up 
7) The timer

Algorithm:

1) Get access to the entire grid, score and timer using query selectors
2) Write a function for the mole to pop randomly
    a) First, the existing mole in a cell should be removed
    b) Pick a random number using math.random()(in range of grid size) and make the mole appear in it.
    c) Log the id of the particular cell to check if the player clicks it
3) Check whether the player clicks on the right cell to increase the score (using event listeners)
4) set interval for the mole to randomly pop
5) Write a function for the timer to go down and check when the game is over.
